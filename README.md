# project-feadreader
Fifth project for Udacity's FEND nanodegree program.

# What this project is about
In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.We use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## My steps to complete the project
1. I took the JavaScript Testing [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud549)
2. I downloaded the [required project assets](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).
3. After exploring the given material,I started implementing the tests one by one. After writing each test,I reviewed the functionality of the application within my browser and I made sure that each test passes before moving to the next one. 

## How to run the tests
 After cloning or downloading the file,use the index.html file to run the tests. The test's code is in feedreader.js file inside jasmine/spec folder.

 If you want to see a live demo of the tests,visit the link provided on the bottom of this README.

 After the page loads,all the tests pass. You can examine each test or each suite seperately by clicking on it. After passing,the test's name is green.
